# **Robotic manipulation and sensing of deformable objects in domestic and industrial applications: a survey**

## 1. Potential Application of Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM)

- medicine (e.g. surgical assistance)
- food handling (e.g. handling fragile product in food industry)
- manufacturing (e.g. manipulate flexible objects)
- domestic chores (dressing, feeding)

## 2. Limitaion of Rigid-body Manipulation Theory in DOM

- Form Closure Assumption (No relative Motion when applying kinematic contraints) 
- Force Closure Assumption (Force balance after applying arbitrary external force with a set of contact points)

## 3. Categories of Deformable Object (DO)

### 3.1 Based on Geometry
- Uniparam & No Compression Strength (e.g. cables, strings, ropes)
- Uniparam & Large Strain 
- Biparam & No Compression Strength (e.g. Shirts, pants, curtains, and fabric sheets)
- Biparam & Large Strain (e.g. paper, cards and foam sheets)
- Triparam (e.g. Sponge, plush toys and food products)
